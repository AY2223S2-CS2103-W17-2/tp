### Project: Dengue Hotspot Tracker

Dengue Hotspot Tracker is a desktop app for managing dengue cases. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=axmszr)


* **New Feature**: Added the overview, and the ability to change its type
    * Justification: DHT was always meant to provide a quick summary of geographical dengue hotspots in Singapore, and we decided to also allow users to analyze data based on age group and dengue variant.
    * Highlights: This was a very good exercise in OOP, especially as a new feature we were implementing from scratch. Abstracting out each layer of the computation made it much easier for us to tweak it as we made modifications along the way.


* **Enhancement**: Revamped the GUI
  * Justification: The original AB3 GUI did not really suit our needs in terms of tone and aesthetics. We decided to change the colour scheme and rearrange the window slightly to best display the information the DHT was meant to show.
  * Highlights: This feature was challenging because our team had little to no experience with GUI or JavaFX, aside from the iP. We also quickly realised that the AB3 theme was not organized in an intuitive manner, so reverse-engineering each component took some time and effort. It was a fun conversation as we tried to figure out the colour scheme of our final product together.


* **Contributions to the UG:**
  * Added documentation for the `overview` command
  * Updated the screenshots to the newest GUI
  * Touched up the formatting, and other general small nit fixes


* **Contributions to the DG:**
  * to be added soon


* **Contributions to the team-based tasks:**
  * Refactored tags to variants as a follow up to Markus' overall refactoring.
  * 


* **Review/mentoring contributions:**
  * to be added soon


* **Contributions beyond the project team:**
  * to be added soon
