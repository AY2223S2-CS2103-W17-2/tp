### Project: Dengue Hotspot Tracker

Dengue Hotspot Tracker is a desktop app for managing dengue cases. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 9.5 kLoC.

Given below are my technical contributions to the project:
 - Refactored classes within the parser package to suit the project's needs.
    - Postal Codes are now considered.
