## Introduction

DengueHotspotTracker (DHT) is a **desktop app for managing Dengue Cases, optimized for**
**use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Purpose of this application:
Dengue fever is a prevalent mosquito-borne disease in many parts of the world, including Singapore. The National 
Environmental Agency (NEA) of Singapore is responsible for monitoring and controlling the spread of this disease. 
To aid in this task, a new application called DengueHotspotTracker (DHT) has been developed, which allows NEA to 
track all reported cases of dengue fever in Singapore.

This application serves as an address book, containing the name, postal code, age, date, and (optional) variant type
of the reported case. The user-friendly interface provides an easy-to-view overview of the cases, enabling NEA to 
monitor the trends of the disease in different areas, spread in different age groups, and spread of
different variant types of dengue. Overall, this application would allow NEA to stay informed about the latest trends
and take proactive measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `dht.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your DengueHotspotTracker.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar dht.jar` 
command to run
the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all cases.

   * `add n/John Tan p/543299 d/2023 February 13 a/20` : Adds a case named `John Tan` to DengueHotspotTracker.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd case shown in the current list.
   
   * `find n/John` : Finds all cases with name John (non-case sensitive) and shows it in a filtered list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all cases.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

   * `undo 5` : Undo 5 previous actions.

   * `redo 5` : Redo 5 previous actions.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [v/VARIANT]` can be used as `n/John Doe v/DENV1` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Multiple date formats are accepted, as long as `yyyy`, `MM`/`MMM`/`MMMM` and `dd` are present,
  with no extra alphanumeric characters.<br>
  e.g `d/2000-january-01`, `d/jan 2000 01`, `d/20000101` will all work.<br>
  When it is ambiguous whether a sequent of digits corresponds to `MM` or `dd` or `yyyy`, 
  the first sequence of 4 digits will be read as `yyyy`, then the first sequence of 2 digits
  is read into `MM`, then `dd` is the last to be read in. Thus, `20000102` is read as 2nd Jan 2000.

* Items in curly brackets `{ }` separated by vertical lines `|` form a set from which one option is to be chosen.<br>
  e.g `{ p/ | a/ | v/ }` means that exactly one of `p/`, `a/` and `v/` must be chosen.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[v/VARIANT]...` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `v/DENV1`, `v/DENV1 v/DENV2`, etc.

* Parameters with prefixes can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/POSTAL`, `p/POSTAL n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but was specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if `p/123414 p/567878` was given, only `p/567878` will be parsed.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (e.g. `clear`, `list`, `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command `help 123` was given, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For postal codes, the user may choose to enter a sequence of 6 digits, or the letter `"S"` or `"s"` followed by the sequence of 6 digits. Postal codes should be valid, i.e. their first two digits should start with a valid postal sector in Singapore.

![AddCommandExample](images/AddCommandExample.png)

<br>

### Editing a case: `edit`

Edits an existing case in DengueHotspotTracker.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [a/AGE] [p/POSTAL] [d/DATE] [v/DENGUE_VARIANT]...`

* Edits the case at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed case list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â¦â
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing dengue variants, all existing variants of the case will be removed i.e adding of variants is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the caseâs dengue variants by typing `v/` without
  specifying any variants after it.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/912345 d/2001-01-01` Edits the postal code and date of the 1st case to be `S912345` and `2001-01-01`
  respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower v/` Edits the name of the 2nd case to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all tagged dengue variants.
![EditCommandExample](images/EditCommandExample.png)

<br>

### Deleting cases: `delete`

Deletes the specified case(s) from DengueHotspotTracker. The cases can be specified with indexes, a date, or a date range.

Format: `delete INDEX...` or `delete d/DATE` or `delete [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE]`, where at least one of the optional fields must be provided.

* Deletes cases at the specified `INDEX`es, cases from the specified `DATE`, or cases falling within the specified range from `START_DATE` to `END_DATE` inclusive.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed case list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â¦â
* The command will fail if multiple indexes are given and at least one of them is out of range of the displayed case list.
* If a start date is given without an end date, the range will be taken to end at the latest date in DengueHotspotTracker.
* Likewise, if an end date is given without a start date, the range will be taken to start at the earliest date in DengueHotspotTracker.
* The `sd/` and `ed/` arguments can be given in any order.
* The start date must come before or be the same as the end date.
* The three variations of the delete command should not be used together, i.e. indexes should not be provided with dates, and `d/` should not co-occur with `sd/` or `ed/`.

Examples:
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st case in the results of the `find` command.
* `find p/s666` followed by `delete d/2023-03-23` deletes the cases from 23rd March 2023 in the results of the `find` 
command.
* * `find p/243` followed by `delete sd/2023-03-20 ed/2023-03-27` deletes the cases from 20th March 2023 to 27th March 
2023 inclusive in the results of the `find` command.
* `list` followed by `delete 2 3` deletes the 2nd and 3rd cases in DengueHotspotTracker.
![DeleteCommandExample](images/DeleteCommandExample.png)

<br>

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the **current view** of DengueHotspotTracker.

Format: `clear`

Examples:
* `list` followed by `clear` clears all cases from DengueHotspotTracker.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `clear` deletes all cases with names that include "Betsy".

<br>

### Listing all cases: `list`

Displays all cases in DengueHotspotTracker.

Format: `list`

<br>

### Finding cases by prefixes: `find` 

Finds cases which match the given prefixes. Date ranges and age ranges are also supported using the new prefixes
`sd/` `ed/` `sa/` `ea/`.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/POSTAL] [v/VARIANT]... { [a/AGE] | [sa/START_AGE] [ea/END_AGE] } \`<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { [d/DATE] | [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE] }</code>

* The search is case-insensitive for all tags.
  * e.g. `n/hans` will match `Hans` or `hAns`
* Prefixes for date `sd/` `ed/` and age ranges `sa/` `ea/` cannot be used in conjunction with the specific 
date `d/` or age `a/` prefixes respectively
  * e.g. `find n/Alex d/2011-11-10 sd/2005-10-10` will throw an error 
* For names, partial words will be matched 
  * e.g. `n/Han` will match `Hans` and `Abrahan`
* For postal codes, the beginning of the postal code will be matched 
  * e.g. `p/10` will match `S101234` but not `S123410`
* For postal codes, the user may choose to include an `"S"` or `"s"` character or not
  * e.g. `p/S10` will match `S101234`
  * e.g. `p/s10` will also match `S101234`
* Persons matching all given prefixes will be returned.
  * e.g. `find n/Alex p/s101` will match only those cases with both name `alex` and of postal code that begins with `s101`
* For variants, the user may choose to include multiple variant `v/` prefixes.
  * e.g. `find v/DENV1 v/DENV2` is a valid command 
* Only those which have the caught the multiple variants of dengue will be filtered by find 
  * e.g. `find v/DENV1 v/DENV2` will only return all cases of people who have caught both DENV1 and DENV2 before.
* Date ranges and age ranges will function even if only one of the two prefixes are specified.
  * e.g `find sd/2010-11-10` is a valid command and will show all cases that happened after and on 2010-11-10.
  * e.g `find ed/2011-10-10` is a valid command and will show all cases that happened before and on 2011-10-10.
  * e.g `find sa/10` is a valid command and will show all cases of people who are older and of the same age as 10.
  * e.g `find ea/50` is a valid command and will show all cases of people who are younger and of the same age as 50.
* Only valid names, dates, ages, variant names are allowed
  * e.g `find n/#erwin` will fail since names do not allow for special characters
  * e.g `find d/2000/13/10` will fail since 13 is not a valid month.
  * e.g `find a/200` will fail since this application only accepts ages 0 - 199.
  * e.g `find v/denver` will fail since `denver` is not a valid dengue variant name.
* Only valid date and age ranges are allowed.
  * e.g `find sa/50 ea/12` will fail since the end age is earlier than the start age.
  * e.g `find sd/2000/10/10 ed/1999/10/10` will fail since the end date is earlier than the start date.

Examples:
* `find v/denv1` finds all cases with `DENV1` in their variant tags.
